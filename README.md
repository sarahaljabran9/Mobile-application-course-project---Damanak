# Damanak (ضمانك) — Receipt & Warranty Keeper

A mobile application that helps users organize product warranties, store digital receipts, track warranty expiry dates, and receive reminders before coverage ends. The app supports local storage for offline access and cloud synchronization to help preserve warranty records across devices.

## The problem

Warranties are proven by paper receipts. Thermal receipts fade within months, receipts get scattered, and nothing warns the owner that coverage is about to end. A repair that should have been free becomes a paid one.

Existing warranty apps are English-only, require an account, and upload receipt images — which contain purchase and payment details — to third-party servers.

## The solution

Damanak stores receipts and purchase data entirely on the device. It calculates each warranty's expiry date, shows every product's status at a glance, and sends notifications before coverage ends. No account, no server, no internet required.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[org]/[repo].git
```

1. Open the project in Android Studio (Ladybug or newer).
2. Let Gradle sync finish.
3. Run on an emulator or device with API 24+.

Grant the camera and notification permissions when prompted — receipt capture and expiry reminders depend on them.
